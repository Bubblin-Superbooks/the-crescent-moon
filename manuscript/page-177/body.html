If you had been longer in this country you’d have heard of me; and you wouldn’t have heard much good.  A fellow who makes his living as I do is not usually an exemplary person.  No doubt a lady would be shocked by my way of living.  I don’t know any, so that is no odds to me.  When your neighbour Godovius hears that I was here, and probably he will hear sooner or later, I shall find myself clapped into jail at Dar-es-Salaam.  If only I had the use of my hands I could get out of this country.  In B. E. A. they know me well enough.  And I’m not “wanted” for anything I’m more than usually ashamed of.  It’s ivory poaching.  I’ve never been a great believer in any game laws: and particularly German ones.  But I realise that I’m done . . . more or less.  There are only two alternatives: to shelter with you at Luguru and fight it out, or to throw in my hand on Godovius’s</p></div> </div>

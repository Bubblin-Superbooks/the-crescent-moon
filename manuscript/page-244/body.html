<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">laugh at all missionary work and talk about the folly of ramming Christianity down the throats of people who have good working religions of their own.  They are just as wide of the mark as the others.  I’ve known a good many missionaries; and for the most part I believe they’re neither worse nor better than their fellows.  They’re just men.  And men are mostly good . . . even the worst of them.  If this poor fellow Bullace drank there’s a good deal to be said for him.  Most Europeans who live in the tropics, particularly if they live alone in a place like Luguru, do drink.  At one time—about the time of the Boer War—I drank about as much as any man could do and live.  Loneliness—loneliness will drive a man to drink, if he hasn’t some strong interest to keep him going.  I had Africa.  Probably Bullace had nothing.  I told you that I’ve heard strange things about the Waluguru.  I daresay Bullace found that he was a failure . . . a hopeless failure, without any chance of getting away</p></div> </div>

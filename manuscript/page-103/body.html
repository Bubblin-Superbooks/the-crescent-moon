<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“My dear boy, you must be ill.”</p><p>He flared up in a way that was quite unusual for him.</p><p>“Ill? . . .  Don’t talk nonsense, Eva. . . .  I’m never ill.  I haven’t time to be ill.”</p><p>But a few minutes later he fell a-shivering, shaking horribly within his blanket.</p><p>“I believe there is something the matter with me,” he said.  “But it can’t be fever.  It can’t possibly be fever.  I’ve never missed taking my quinine, and you never get fever if you take quinine.  My head aches.  I’d better go to bed.”</p><p>He stalked off to his room, a pitifully fantastic figure in his blanket.  Eva brought him some hot milk.  He complained that it tasted bitter, of the gourd, but she made him swallow it.  Then she took his p. 56temperature and found that it was a hundred and four.  The thermometer chattered between his teeth.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">trust me?  Why?  You are not like your brother. . . .  Your brother will be all right.  You are meant for me.  That is why you came here to Luguru; that was what brought you to me the other night.  You don’t realise your beautiful youth . . . the use of life.  You are like a cold, northern meadow in a dream of winter.  You lie waiting for the sun.  And I am like the sun.  It is for you to awaken into spring.  You don’t know the beauty of which you are capable.  And you’ll never know it.  You’ll never blossom in loveliness.  You’ll waste your youth and your strength on your damned brother, and then you’ll marry, when there is no more hope, some bloodless swine of a clergyman like him.  So to your death.  You will have no life.  Death is all they think of.  And here is life waiting for you—life bursting, overflowing, like the life of the forest.  You won’t have it.  You will fly in the face of nature, you’ll fight forces stronger than yourself . . .”</p></div> </div>

I suppose he would have led a wild, prophetic sort of existence, depending for his sustenance on locusts and wild honey (there were plenty of both or the ministrations of ravens . . . just until he discovered that a man can’t live on nothing.  In a way it was a misfortune that his physical wants were so completely provided for by Eva’s care; it gave him a chance of such complete absorption in one idea as can be good for no man.  In the end it gave him time for brooding on his difficulties.  Of course, for all his fervour, he was exactly the wrong sort of man for missionary work; but, as Eva herself admitted, he was built for martyrdom.  They didn’t expect in those days how literally he would get it.  Win it, he would have said. )</p></div> </div>

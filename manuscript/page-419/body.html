You realise, no doubt, the trust which that implies, and that we are quite in your hands.  But my own position is quite different.  Perhaps you do not know what religion means to a man, or how a man in my position regards his mission.  I was sent to Africa to devote myself to these unfortunate people.  I have a responsibility.  If the devil has entered into their hearts this is the occasion in which they need me most.  You spoke just now a little contemptuously p. 242of Scripture . . .  I am a minister, and perhaps it means more to me.  At any rate these words, if you’ll have the patience to hear me, mean a great deal: ‘<em>He that is an hireling</em>, <em>and not the shepherd</em>, <em>whose own the sheep are not</em>, <em>seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth</em>.’  You know who spoke those words.  Mine must be the part of the good shepherd.  If I behaved as a hireling I could not bear to live.”</p></div> </div>

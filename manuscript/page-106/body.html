At first he fought desperately; but in a little while, realising that he was powerless, he submitted to her tenderness.  “Really,” she said, “he was awfully good . . . much nicer than when he was well.”  She found him patient and pathetic . . . almost lovable, quite different from the acknowledged success of the family which he had been at home; and she discovered in him—in his tired eyes and even in his voice-an amazing hidden likeness to their mother which almost moved her to tears.  It seemed as if the fever had suddenly made him a man instead of the incarnation of a spiritual force.  Not even a man, but a frail, puzzled boy, with no pretensions in the world.  He appealed to her dormant instincts of maternity, making her all tenderness.

And dark . . . perhaps that was only to be expected from the sun of those parts; but she had always imagined that Germans were fair.  In no way did he answer to her ideas of Germanity.  He was exceedingly polite: after all, she supposed most foreigners were that: but to the exotic grace which was the traditional birthright of Continentals there was here added strength.  She had never met a man who gave such an impression of smooth capability.  “He looked clever,” she said.  It doesn’t seem ever to have struck her that Godovius was a Jew, even though she quickly decided that he wasn’t typically German.  Indefinitely she had been prejudiced against him; but now that she saw him she liked him. </p></div> </div>

I am sufficiently gallant not to hurry you.  You shall think it over.  A week will give you time to think.  It is always a shock for a virtuous woman to realise. . . .  But we will leave it at that.  You will see that I am neither jealous nor ungenerous.  You have an opportunity of doing a good turn to your brother and to the man in whom, to my mind, you are so unreasonably interested.  One may be magnanimous.  <em>You</em> call it ‘playing the game.’  You shall think it over, and then we shall come to an agreement—but you wouldn’t be so foolish as not to do so—certain unavoidable things will happen; as unavoidable as if they were acts of God.  I am God here.  And you will have yourself to thank.  So, for the present, we’ll say ‘Auf Wiedersehn.’  Perhaps you would like to return to your friend in the <em>banda</em>.  He will help you to make up your mind.  You can tell him that this is a bad place for ivory. </p></div> </div>
